## What is TuskeDex?

TuskeDex is an open source platform to exchange [Tuske](https://tuske.network) for fiat currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP or other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BCH.

Main features:

- All communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on TuskeDex happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: TuskeDex supports arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but arbitrators never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because it's not needed. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Tuske network.


## Status of the project


Note that TuskeDex is being actively developed. If you find issues or bugs, please let us know.
